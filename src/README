hadling errors- we used exceptions. the smart way of doing it in my opinion is by bubbling up the exception.
means we need to throw and error but the only function that will catch it is main .
so we need to "bubble" it all the way up. so we should not deal with it only at the end
in that way main function will catcjh accordingly the right exception.

-I could add another regex representing float variables but maybe better way is to
split it to class of types - an abstract class of type so changes wont have to be made in mutual classes
so much , only add a class that takes care of float.

-classes- we should also create class classParser that also extends Parser and use parservariables and
parserMethods to parser.
-methods return type- i think it can be done by simply adding field to method class.

regex for int variables parser line:

1.DECLARE_AND_ASSIGN_INT="[\\s]*[a-zA-Z_$][a-zA-Z_$0-9]*[\\s]*[=][\\s]*[(-|+)][\\s]*[0-9]+";
2. DECLARE_ONLY_INT="[\\s]*[a-zA-Z_$][a-zA-Z_$0-9]*";

3.DEFINE_INT_VARIABLE_REGEX  =  "int[\\s]+"+"[("+DECLARE_ONLY_INT+"|"+DECLARE_AND_ASSIGN_INT+")[\\s]*\\,]*"+
            "("+DECLARE_ONLY_INT+"|"+DECLARE_AND_ASSIGN_INT+")[\\s]*;[\\n]?";

1.declare+assign->space(0 or more) than the name nust start with charachter and than can be digit..
more spaces are possible(0/more) than "=" once, spaces again then + or - again spaces(0 or more) and than only digits
because its int.

2. spaces(0 or more) than at name of variable must start with charachter than it can contain digits/charachters.

3.at first we get  simply int , than it may have some spaces(1 or more) than it may declare it only without assigning or
assigning also this is why it is like or - "|"  and eventually(after possibly ore spaces) it can declare multiple times ,
this is why i wrapped all with [...\\,]*so the  regular can repeat itself and finish with , 0 or more times.
at the end at least 1 declaration/declaration+assigning shoul be done and afterwards ";\\n" (didnt know for sure about
end of line so added-?)


my classes-
-----------
i divided to parser+"container(static)" and reading+objects of methods and variables that will be eventually
in container after parsing.
in order to separate parsing and creating variables/methods/reading+checking the lines and their storage.
